# CamCraft

## Project Description

CamCraft is a web-based application designed to generate and analyze cam profiles. This project focuses on calculating and presenting key parameters such as angle, displacement, velocity, and acceleration in a tabular format. While the application does not draw the cam diagram, it provides essential data that can be used for further analysis or visualization.

The frontend is built using JSP (JavaServer Pages) for an interactive and user-friendly interface. The backend is powered by Java Servlets, ensuring efficient processing and accurate calculations.

## Features

- **User Input Interface**: Collects all necessary data for cam profile calculation, including follower specifications, cam profile parameters, and motion profile segments.
- **Dynamic Segment Handling**: Allows users to specify the number of segments and their respective parameters dynamically.
- **Detailed Output**: Presents calculated values of angle, displacement, velocity, and acceleration in a neatly formatted table.
- **Frontend and Backend Integration**: Utilizes JSP for frontend and Java Servlets for backend processing to deliver a seamless user experience.

## How It Works

1. **User Inputs**: Users provide inputs through an HTML form, specifying the follower type, base circle radius, lift, number of segments, and details for each segment.
2. **Data Processing**: The inputs are sent to the backend servlet, where the cam profile is calculated based on the provided data.
3. **Output Generation**: The servlet processes the data and returns a table with calculated values for each specified angle increment.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSP
- **Backend**: Java Servlets
- **Data Format**: CSV (for output)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/camcraft.git
    ```

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
    - Install a suitable Java Development Kit (JDK).
    - Set up a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.

3. **Deploy the Application**:
    - Deploy the JSP and servlet files to your servlet container.
    - Access the application via your web browser.

4. **Use the Application**:
    - Fill in the required inputs on the form.
    - Submit the form to get the calculated cam profile data.
